## About the project ‚Ñπ 

The project consists of a news homepage where users can interact by hovering and clicking on the available news. 

The homepage features a highlighted news article with a short description and a button for visiting the complete news. 
There are three recent news articles on the side and 3 most-read news articles at the bottom. 

Being responsive for all devices, users using small devices can visualize a hamburguer menu with an opening and closing effect. 

### The challenge üöÄ

Frontend Mentor is a platform that provides challenges for front-end developers. Throughout the development of this project, I had the final design image and a folder containing the images used for that. Therefore, I had to develop the website adjusting the margins, sizes, paddings, etc., based on my personal wishes.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### My gains and tools for testing üõ†  

Throughout the development of this project I focused on applying best practices for HTML structure, including descriptive names for IDs and classes, meta description, attributes for improving performance and accessibility, etc. The tool I used for testing those parameters was [Lighthouse](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=pt-BR&pli=1), provided by Google. 

I also focused on developing a responsive website for all devices, providing a flexible design for improving user experience. For testing those parameters I used [Responsive Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=pt-BR) and [Mobile Simulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mobile-simulator-responsi/ckejmhbmlajgoklhgbapkiccekfoccmk).

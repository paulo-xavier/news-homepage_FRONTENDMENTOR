## About the project ℹ 

The project consists of a news homepage where users can interact by hovering and clicking on the available news. 

The homepage features a highlighted news article with a short description and a button for visiting the complete news. 
There are three recent news articles on the side and 3 most-read news articles at the bottom. 

Being responsive for all devices, users using small devices can visualize a hamburguer menu with an opening and closing effect. 

### The challenge 🚀

Frontend Mentor is a platform that provides challenges for front-end developers. Throughout the development of this project, I had the final design image and a folder containing the images used for that. Therefore, I had to develop the website adjusting the margins, sizes, paddings, etc., based on my personal wishes.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### My gains and tools for testing 🎁  

Throughout the development of this project I focused on applying best practices for HTML structure, including descriptive names for IDs and classes, meta description, attributes for improving performance and accessibility, etc. The tool I used for testing those parameters was Lighthouse, provided by Google. 

I also focused on developing a responsive website for all devices, providing a flexible design for improving user experience. For testing those parameters I used Responsive Viewer and Simulador de Celular.
